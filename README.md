- 👋 Hi, I’m @NastyaBezr. My name is Nastya Bezrukova. I am 16 years old in 2024. I'm just starting my career as a programmer.
- 
- 👀 I am interested in developing programs in a wide variety of programming languages. However, now I only know c++ and the basic libraries for it:(
- 
- 🌱 At the moment, I am practicing writing code for Olympiad tasks in c++, while doing other interesting projects in html/unity and others.
- 
- 💞️ I would like to be an intern and look at the work of more professional programmers, while learning this craft at the same time.
- 
- 📫 To contact me, you can write to this email: number1rus@mail.ru
- 
- 😄 A little more about me: I am only 16 years old (as of 08/15/2024). I really want to develop in programming and try something new. If you have any advice for me, please email me definitely!
